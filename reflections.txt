Your response goes here!

What new skills have you learned? - Nothing specific to web development (yet) as I have done a fair bit of HTML in the past. However, I did find the opening project 'Project: Establishing Developer Mindset' offered some helpful advice on the road forward.

What has been easy? - Honestly most of it so far. As I mentioned above I have done some HTML in the past so the hard part is still to come.

What has been difficult? - See previous answer.

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far? - Haven't needed them so far. The lessons and MDN have been enough.
